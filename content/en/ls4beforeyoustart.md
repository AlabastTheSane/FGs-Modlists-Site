Before you get started installing or playing Living Skyrim, it's important to note a few things:

{{< alert context="warning" icon="⚠️" >}}
**Important!** 

Sections labeled important like this one will tell you when you need to pay extra attention to something.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert context="danger" icon="🛑" >}}
**WARNING!**

**Warning blocks like this one will warn you when you absolutely must not forget to do something. Failure to heed warning blocks is cause for disaster.**
{{< /alert >}}

- You are not required to have Nexus Premium to install Living Skyrim, however, it is highly recommended. Nexus Premium will cut your install time to a fraction of what it would be by automating both the mod download and mod install processes of installing the list.
- As of version 4.0.0, Living Skyrim requires approximately 347GB of hard drive space (This number *includes* the download size). Installing to an SSD/NVMe is not required, but also highly recommended. Download and installation times vary based on your computer and internet speeds, but expect the entire process to take a few hours. If you are installing the list without Nexus Premium, expect the process to take a couple of days of 8+ hour sessions downloading mods.
- To avoid installation/gameplay issues please ensure Living Skyrim is not installed to any protected Windows locations such as: My Documents, The Desktop, Program Files, etc.
- If you are not familiar with the contents of this modlist, a complete documentation of every mod in the list including links to the mods is available on the LS3 Modlist Spreadsheet.
- If you instead only wish for a brief overview of the major changes this modlist makes, you should refer to the Important Mods You Need to Know About section of this document.
- Autosaves for Living Skyrim are disabled. You should make your quicksave button your best friend (usually, the F5 key).
- Continuing the last point, it is always better to save **before** entering a loading screen instead of after. After a loading screen it is very likely that scripts will be running for at least 30 seconds, so if you must save after a loading screen, at least wait that long before doing so. When practical, try to avoid saving during combat.
- Wabbajack does support updating an existing installation of a modlist. However, as part of this process, it does delete files that don't match with what it is installing. This includes RaceMenu presets, mods you've added/changed, and possibly even save files. It is a good practice to keep backups of your save files so that you can update safely. Saves are stored within the folder you install Living Skyrim to.
- Living Skyrim has been updated such that NPCs and player characters are never nude. Underwear is worn by all NPCs and the player character and cannot be unequipped.
- Adding to, changing, or removing from Living Skyrim is not supported. See the Adding to Living Skyrim section of this document for more details.
- As many common issues as I could find have been documented in the Common Issues section of this document. Refer to this before asking for support.
- If you want some tips related to getting started playing the list, refer to the Getting Started in Living Skyrim section of this document.
- By default, Living Skyrim has the game running in exclusive fullscreen mode to assist with game performance.

## System Specifications
Living Skyrim requires a good to excellent computer to run. Textures range from 512x512 to 4K and everything in between. The following system is ForgottenGlory's personal computer and is able to run the list at a constant 60FPS including ENB at 1440p monitor resolution.

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X @ 4.2GHz
- RAM: G.Skill TridentZ Neo 32GB DDR4 3600MHz CL16
- GPU: nVidia RTX 2080 Super 8GB (8192MB actual)
- Monitor: Dell S2716DGR 2560x1440 @ 144hz
- Storage: Sabrent Rocket 2TB M.2 NVMe 2280; Samsung EVO 860 250GB; SeaGate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPM

In general, it is recommended that you have a processor with a clock speed of at least 3GHz and a graphics card with at least 6GB of VRAM. 4GB graphics cards may be able to run the list if you do not use ENB, but it is not guaranteed.

As for RAM, 16GB is the minimum recommended specification for running the list. 32GB is the ideal amount, and anything more than that is honestly overkill for this list.

If your PC is struggling to run Living Skyrim, see the Performance Optimizations section of this document for tips and tricks to receive better performance.

# Important Mods You Need To Know About

## The Performance Profile
Living Skyrim 4 ships with 2 different profiles, those being the Standard profile and the Performance profile. The latter of such is ideal for use if you're not quite getting your desired performance out of the Standard profile. MO2's Profile selector, located in the top left, just above the mods pane, allows you to easily swap between the two. A visual representation of such can be [found here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1034149881390051482/1047990987139600414/image.png).
Saves are compatible between the two profiles, though you will need transfer the saves. You can easily do so by clicking the Profile selection dropdown and clicking <Manage>. In the window that opens up, click the profile you are currently on, click the Transfer Saves button, then transfer the saves over to the Global location (left hand side). From there, close that window and select the profile you'd like to switch to, click Transfer Saves again, then transfer your saves from the Global location to the new profile.

## The Population Mods
Living Skyrim wouldn't be complete without an entire set of mods to increase the population of the world. [Immersive College NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9252), [Inconsequential NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36334), and [Citizens of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069) make up the core of the population increasing mods, fleshing out cities and towns with tons of new NPCs to interact with. On the enemy side of things, [Unlimited Hostile Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67479) and [Hand Placed Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59249) increase the enemy count of the world. You'll need to prepare heavily to take on larger dungeons or bring along some followers.

To round out the population mods, we also have [Immersive Patrols](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/718), [Man Those Borders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29502), and [Populated Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29452). Overall, the world is jam-packed with people.

## The Quest & Guild Mods
WIP

## The Magic Mods
[Smart Cast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32847) has returned in Living Skyrim 4. With Smart Cast you can set up specific rules and conditions under which spells will be cast for you - assuming you have the magicka to cast them. It also lets you combine spells into a single cast, again, assuming you have the magicka to cast them both at the same time. This mod has quite a few features available, reading its mod page is highly recommended.

[Spellforge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46482) completely changes how your character learns new spells. Instead of "eating" the book and learning the spell, you now craft the spells you want from the Spellforge, which can be found just beside the bridge leading to the College of Winterhold, or alternatively you can buy the Spellforge Manual at any novice vendor, such as court mages. From the Spellforge, you can craft spells using handy and informative menus, using Arcane Resin as a resource to do so. More in-depth info can be found in-game or on the modpage.

[Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839), [Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170), and [The Elder Scrolls - Tomebound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21403) make up the mods adding new spells to Living Skyrim. Between all of these and the additional options found below, it is possible to have multiple mage playthroughs and never do the same build twice.

[Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138), [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099), and [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) are all included to make magic as diverse as possible with a huge breadth of options. Pilgrim covers the religious aspect of the game, Thaumaturgy covers enchantments, and Mundus covers the various standing stones of the world.

## The Combat Mods
The core of combat in LS4 is comprised of [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) and [MCO - ADXP](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/mods/attack), the former being a modern combat overhaul, complete with a custom stamina system and timed block mechanics, the latter being an animation overhaul for all attacks, bringing attack commitment and general combat gameplay more in line with modern action RPGs. To compliment this, [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) allows you to dodge attacks, and [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) brings hitstop, swing trails, and realistic collision for a very tight and modern feeling combat package. Additionally, [Know Your Enemy Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55045) brings new depth to fights, allowing you to deal with enemies easier with a bit of planning. The [Archery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10926) mod brings more realistic archery gameplay, with faster arrows and gravity to overhaul ranged combat.

## The Perks & Leveling Mods
At the core of the Living Skyrim leveling up process is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), which changes how you level up to require you to complete quests, explore, and clear dungeons. To make this process more rewarding, we've also included [Achieve That]() and [Perks From Questing](). You'll also find overhauled perk trees from [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191), [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639), and [Manbeast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746). Living Skyrim also includes [Reading is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026) to make finding skill books more incentivizing.

## The Economy & Loot Mods
The economy in Living Skyrim is built to be as dynamic and interesting as the rest of the list, starting with [Economy Overhaul and Speechcraft Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542). Similarly, you'll also find the inclusion of [NPC Bartering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21307) and [Trade Routes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12358) to make trade something you can engage with fully. For completeness, [Khajiits Steal Too](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18231) is included to round out the caravaneer experience.

On the loot side of things, we start with [Loot Overhaul - Rarity and Abundance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26732). This makes loot more dynamic and interesting, especially when coupled with [Dynamic Dungeon Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10308), [Narrative Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12812), and [Lock Related Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11342). For you treasure hunters out there, Living Skyrim also includes [New Treasure Hunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19469).

## The HUD/Menu Mods
As with all versions of Living Skyrim, the HUD and menus have been completely overhauled. At the base, we have [Nordic UI]() to bring a consistent and much improved look to the entire menu and HUD setup. You'll also find your usual suspects like [moreHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12688), [A Matter of Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12937), [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252), and [TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775). Living Skyrim also includes a number of additions and improvements to the vanilla HUD experience such as a custom main menu setup, [Detection Meter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63057), [Oxygen Meter 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64532), [Security Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58224), [Atlas Map Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104), and [Compass Navigation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74484).

## The Stealth Mods
You'll find stealth to be much more difficult and less of an "easy button" in Living Skyrim. This is thanks to mods such as [Realistic AI Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345), [Suspicious City Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38762), and [Store Entrance Doorbells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56196). To help you out, though, [Mum's The Word](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27713) and [Better Stealth AI for Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17600) are also included.

## Crafting Mods
Most of the crafting systems in the game have been overhauled. This is primarily thanks to [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138). For smithing, [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) is included allowing you to order specific items if you don't have the necessary skill to make them. Be warned, though, the items ordered with Honed Metal are very expensive!

To make self-crafting more convenient, [Linked Crafting Storage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64772) is also included.

## ImMuRsHuN & Miscellaneous Mods
For your roleplaying pleasure, an entire host of mods have been added to improve that area of the game. From [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), which allows you to go camping, to [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001), you'll find the game as "immersive" as you like. Some realism mods in the form of [Wash That Blood Off](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62358), [Wade In Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71418), [Sit on Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74446), and [Simply Knock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14098) are also included allowing you to interact with the world itself in new ways. 

[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) and [Skyrim's Paraglider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256) are included to change how you can travel across the land. Changing how you traverse dungeons is [EVG Animated Traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) and several realistic animations have been added thanks to [EVG Conditional Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006). [Take Notes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13570) is included as well, allowing you to chronicle your journey.

## Dungeons & New Lands
Several new sets of dungeons and entire new lands have been added to the game. [Hammet's Dungeon Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186) adds many extremely high quality dungeons to the world and [Dungeons - Revisited](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51798) expands many of the existing dungeons in the world. On the new lands side of things, we have [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565), [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917), and [New Vominheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70963). Several quests also add new areas to explore, such as [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), [Carved Brink](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24351), [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996), and [Moon and Star](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4301).

For convenience, [Simple Offence Suppression](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41764) is included to avoid any accidents.


## Adding to Living Skyrim

Many Skyrim modders ask the question: “Can I add mods to Living Skyrim?” (Or, “Can I remove mods from Living Skyrim?”, or, “Can I change the mods included with Living Skyrim?”)

If you are asking this question from a perspective of just installing the mod and expecting it to work, then the answer is a resounding, unequivocal NO.

The longer and slightly more technical answer is: “I don’t know, can you?”

To expand on this: nobody knows whether you can add a certain mod or not. Adding to, changing, or removing from the list isn’t a yes/no question. In 99.9% of cases, the answer is, “Yes, but…“

The “but…” part of that answer refers to the process of installing any mod and stems from a deeply rooted belief that mods are either compatible with each other, or they are not. Assuming that any mod is (or is not) compatible with any other mod is absurd. Every mod can be made to work with every other mod, the real questions you should be asking are: “How much work would it take to add this mod?” and “Do I have the knowledge, tools, and skills to add this mod?”

And unfortunately, the answer to those questions is a resounding, unequivocal, “It depends.” And it depends on the answers to these questions, which you, and only you, can answer: Does it require compatibility/consistency patching in xEdit? Does it require modifications in Creation Kit? Does it require that it be loaded in a certain place in the load order? Does it need additional mods (which also require answers to these questions) to function?

Lastly, I (ForgottenGlory) and the Living Skyrim development team do not support this in any way, shape, or form. If you’re going to add a mod to Living Skyrim, you need to be prepared to do it on your own. I understand this isn’t an ideal answer for people relatively new to modding, but you need to understand that hundreds of hours have been spent putting together Living Skyrim, making it as stable as possible with all the mods working in harmony. Adding a bunch of random mods on top of it and then expecting it to “just work” is naive at best.

“Can I add a mod to Living Skyrim?”

I don’t know, can you?
