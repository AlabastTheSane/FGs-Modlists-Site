## Getting Started in Living Skyrim
` WIP pending feedback from the LS4 Beta `

## Character Customization Mods

When creating your character, you'll find there are a lot of options that are available to you. From hairs to tattoos to eyes and more, Living Skyrim has included a comprehensive suite of mods that allow you to tweak your character's appearance to exactly what you want. And, if you're struggling to figure out where to begin with character creation, a number of presets made by the Living Skyrim community have been included for you to pick from. In general, you'll have more options for everything.

There is one particular mod you need to be aware of during character creation: [High Poly Head](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/). To have your character use High Poly Head, you'll need to change the head part using the RaceMenu slider of the same name to option 3. Note that if you do use High Poly Head, you may need to do some manual sculpting using the RaceMenu sculpt feature to remove any clipping issues with eyebrows or beards.

## A Word About Difficulty

Living Skyrim is intended to be played at the Adept difficulty level. If you wish to have a challenge or find the game too difficult, you can and should adjust the game difficulty as you wish. Adept is merely where I (ForgottenGlory) like to play - it provides a decent challenge without being overly difficult.

Also, while fantastic for roleplaying purposes, ELSA and Classic Classes & Birthsigns can make the game significantly easier. If you wish to have a more difficult time of things - especially in combat - you can and should skip setting up ELSA, and CC&B.

## ELSA

{{< alert context="danger" icon="🛑" >}}
**WARNING!**

**If you are going to use it,  ELSA must be configured before leaving the Alternate Perspective starting room.**
{{< /alert >}}

ELSA gives you a bonus to a single skill based on your character's background. To do this, select the "Reflect" option from your Power/Shout menu and then press the Shout key (Usually Z) to select your background. If you are opting to skip ELSA, simply do not activate this power/shout.

The choices you make in the ELSA menus are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!

## Classic Classes & Birthsigns Reimagined
You will start the game with a book in your inventory called "Classic Classes". Read this book to select a class and birthsign for your character. The book can be safely disposed of as you wish. If you want a challenge, try playing without selecting a class/birthsign. You can still select a birthsign by finding the appropriate standing stone at any time. If you wish to skip using CC&B, simply do not read the book and dispose of it as you wish.

The choices you make in the CC&BR menu are permanent and cannot be changed without starting a new character!

## Mandatory control and MCM settings

When you are finished making your character, a bunch of text will start scrolling in the top left-hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.** If you receive any pop-up messages during this wait, read them, then click through them. The MCM Recording will notify you when it has completed configuring the MCMs for you.

Now, *save your game*. Then *load that save.*

And that's it! The MCMs will be configured for you automatically and you can begin playing.

## Further Changes
Due to some unforseen issues with hotkey bindings during the recording process you may have several overlapping keybinds once you have done the above steps, all known conflicts are listed here, so you can adjust them yourself:

#### Take Notes
 - Open Journal should be bound to the 'B' Key.
