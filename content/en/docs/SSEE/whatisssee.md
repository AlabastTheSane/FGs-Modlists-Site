Skyrim Special Edition Essentials is a barebones, baseline modlist you can install and have a fully out-of-the-box working version of modded Skyrim. It contains all of the bug fixes, patches, modding tools, resources, and optimizations necessary to begin building a modlist on Skyrim Special Edition v1.5.97. It is an excellent starting point for any would-be modlist author.
