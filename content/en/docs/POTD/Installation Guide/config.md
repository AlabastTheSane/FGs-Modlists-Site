### Ultrawide Configuration

In the left pane of MO2 you'll see options for ultrawide UI mods from Nordic UI. This should only be enabled if you are using a 21:9 or 32:9 monitor at 2560x1080 resolution or higher. Enable whichever one matches your screen's aspect ratio and only that one.

### ENB
The default ENB included with Path of the Dovahkiin is [Culminated ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53167). Support is not provided for changing it. You may, however, disable ENB during play by loading into the game and pressing Shift + F12. Disabling ENB will drastically improve performance but will make the game look worse overall.
