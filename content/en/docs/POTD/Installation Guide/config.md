  Configuring the list to fit your system.

There are three mods that can be optionally enabled, depending on your preferences and computer configuration. 

The first is Nordic UI 32x9 or 21x9. This should only be enabled if you are using a 21:9 or 32:9 monitor at 2560x1080 resolution or higher. Enable whichever one matches your screen's aspect ratio and only that one.

The second is QuickLoot, which adds a Fallout 4 style loot menu to bodies, containers, etc. This mod provides a significant quality of life improvement to looting, however it can cause issues with mods that run scripts upon looting certain objects. Enable it, or don't, it's entirely up to your personal preference. If you do enable it, it's recommended that you also enable the retexture for it to match the rest of the Skyrim UI.

### ENB
The default ENB included with Path of the Dovahkiin is [Culminated ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53167). Support is not provided for changing it. You may, however, disable ENB during play by loading into the game and pressing Shift + F12. Disabling ENB will drastically improve performance but will make the game look worse overall.
