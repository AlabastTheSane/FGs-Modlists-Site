  Information you need to know before beginning installing or playing Path of the Dovahkiin.
---

Before you get started installing or playing Path of the Dovahkiin, it's important to note a few things:

{{< alert color="important" title="Important!">}}
<div class="alert-icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</div>
Sections labeled important like this one will tell you when you need to pay extra attention to something.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert color="danger" title="Warning!" >}}
<div class="alert-icon">üõë</div>
Warning blocks like this one will warn you when you absolutely must not forget to do something. Failure to heed warning blocks is cause for disaster.
{{< /alert >}}

- If you instead only wish for a brief overview of the major changes this modlist makes, you should refer to the [Important Mods](/docs/potd/beginners-guide/importantmods) You Need to Know About section of this document.
- Autosaves for Path of the Dovahkiin are disabled. You should make your quicksave button your best friend (usually, the F5 key).
- Continuing the last point, it is always better to save **before** entering a loading screen instead of after. After a loading screen it is very likely that scripts will be running for at least 30 seconds, so if you must save after a loading screen, at least wait that long before doing so. When practical, try to avoid saving during combat.
- Characters in Path of the Dovahkiin are never nude - at minimum they will be wearing underwear.
- By default, Path of the Dovahkiin has the game running in exclusive fullscreen mode to assist with game performance.
