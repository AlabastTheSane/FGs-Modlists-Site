## Creature Profile

Almost all of the mods added in the Creature Profile have MCMs that allow you to tweak or disable things. Check the MCM for your options. Note that some of the mods in the creature profile have very touchy MCMs that require some patience, such as Estrus Chaurus. Be careful and go slow when making changes to these mods.

## Things You Shouldn't Mess With
The following items should not be changed.

### HUD
The various widgets and HUDs are affected by several mods and shouldn't be modified.

### SexLab
The configuration for SexLab itself is set up in such a way that things should work as smoothly as possible. Tweaking things in this MCM isn't recommended.
