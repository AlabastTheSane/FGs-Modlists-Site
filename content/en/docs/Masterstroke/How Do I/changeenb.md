  How do I change ENB settings?

## Changing ENB Settings

To change ENB settings, press Shift + Enter while in-game. This will open the ENB control panel. You can tweak the settings of ENB using this control panel. Once you've made your changes, make sure to click "Save Configuration" and then "Apply Configuration" to save the changes (so you don't have to re-do them) and then apply the changes you've made.

## Disabling ENB

To toggle ENB on and off while in-game, press Shift + F12. Disabling ENB can have massive performance effects, and is highly recommended for people with computer specifications close to the minimum recommended specs.
