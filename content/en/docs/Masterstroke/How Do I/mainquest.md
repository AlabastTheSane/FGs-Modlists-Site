  How do I progress a quest?
---

Many quests in Masterstroke have been modified from their vanilla forms, primarily by [At Your Own Pace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704). You should familiarize yourself with this mod to see how to progress the main story, College of Winterhold, Thieves' Guild, and Companions quests.

Dragonborn and Dawnguard are both delayed until you are high enough level to reasonably take them on thanks to [Timing Is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464). You can tweak this mods' settings in its MCM if you wish.
