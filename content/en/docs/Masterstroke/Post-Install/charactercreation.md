The following steps should only be completed after you have completed the MCM steps for Masterstroke.
{{< /alert >}}

### Sets of Skills

Sets of Skills is a class mod that I encourage you to read the mod page about. It will allow you to select a class for your character that will give you buffs as you level up. Be sure to read the options carefully. To select a class, open the Sets of Skills MCM and pick a class from the dropdown menu.

### OBody

You likely want to customize the body of your character. To do so, *with all menus closed*, press the `letter U` key. A menu will appear with all of the installed body presets. You can select whichever one you like and can change it at any time by pressing the `letter U` key to open the menu again. This also works for NPCs - aim your crosshair at the NPC whose body you would like to change, press the `letter U` key and then pick a new body preset for them. 

### SexLab

The SexLab MCM contains an option for your character to be heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual. You should open the MCM for SexLab and select your character's preference under the Sex Diary menu.

### Hotkeys

Unfortunately MCM Recorder does not like setting hotkeys, so the following hotkeys must be set manually:

#### Take Notes!
- Controls
  - Open Journal: B

#### Immersive HUD
  - Toggle: RAlt
 
#### Valhalla Combat

If you wish you use the Executions feature of Valhalla Combat, you should set its hotkey in the Valhalla Combat MCM.

#### TK Dodge RE

If you wish to change the default dodge key from Left Alt to something else, use the `TK_Dodge_RE.ini` located in `[Install Folder]\mods\TK Dodge RE\SKSE\Plugins` to change it. A list of DirectX Scancodes for keyboard keys can be found [here.](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/DirectX_Scancodes_And_How_To_Use_Them)

#### Dual Wield Block
- Hotkey: V

#### SL Tools
- SL Tools Menu: O

#### Leadership
- Hotkey: K

#### Valhalla Combat
- Compatibility
  - Alternate Blocking Key: V
