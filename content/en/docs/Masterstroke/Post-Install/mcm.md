## MCM Configuration

When you are finished making your character, a bunch of text will start scrolling in the top left-hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.** If you receive any pop-up messages during this wait, click through them.

Now, *save your game*. Then *load that save.*

A popup will appear from SexLab - Sexual Fame talking about a consistence check of Papyrus location storage failing. This popup can be safely ignored, the issue will be resolved in a moment by MCM Recorder.

Once again, text will appear in the top left hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.**

Now, go into the MCM and find MCM Recorder.

Click on the Masterstroke MCM option. You'll be prompted to exit the MCM. Do so. You'll then receive a popup with information about the MCM preset you've chosen. Click "Run Recording".

If you see a message saying "`Could not find MCM Option: Mod name: Sexlab Field name SSL__InstallUpdateSexlab(1.63)`", nothing is wrong, simply press continue and allow the recording to continue.

Once again, ***WAIT.*** This can take up to 10 minutes to complete. During this wait, if you receive any pop-up messages, click through them. When it is finished, you will receive one final pop-up message stating the MCMs are now configured.

Now *save your game*. Then *load that save.* Yes, this must be done a second time.

After this, you just have two final tasks before you begin playing.
