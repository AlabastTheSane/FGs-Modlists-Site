  Required steps to configure mods in Empyrean.
---

Most of the MCMs are already set up for you via MCM Recorder. When you load into the starting area (A heavily modified Realm of Lorkhan), create your character. Once you're done creating your character, you will be prompted to choose a Deity. Worshipping your chosen God will provide benefits,
so take your time, and read through what each God does. Fear not though, if you wish to worship the Overlord Supreme of Cheese, Sheogorath, that's possible. After you've selected which deity you want to worship, wait for all the text to stop scrolling in the left hand corner of your screen.
Once all the text is gone, navigate to the MCM Recorder MCM, and select Empyrean Final Cut. 

The MCM Recording shouldn't take too long to run, and will give you a notification when it is done running. We will get to Important Mods to Pay Attention To in the next section, but once the MCM Recorder says its complete, there are two more steps Ultrawide users (those with a 21x9 resolution) have to follow. Go into the Frostfall MCM, and select Empyrean Ultrawide in the profiles tab, and let it load. Than go inot the Last Seed MCM, and select profile 2. This will allow the status bars to display in the proper positions. After that, you're done.
