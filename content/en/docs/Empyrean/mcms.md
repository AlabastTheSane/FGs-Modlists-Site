  Required steps to configure mods in Empyrean.

Most of the MCMs are already set up for you via MCM Recorder. When you load into the starting area (A heavily modified Realm of Lorkhan), create your character. Once you're done creating your character, you will be prompted to choose a Deity. Worshipping your chosen God will provide benefits,
so take your time, and read through what each God does. Fear not though, if you wish to worship the Overlord Supreme of Cheese, Sheogorath, that's possible. After you've selected which deity you want to worship, wait for all the text to stop scrolling in the left hand corner of your screen.
Once all the text is gone, navigate to the MCM Recorder MCM, and select Empyrean Final Cut. 

The MCM Recording shouldn't take too long to run, and will give you a notification when it is done running. We will get to Important Mods to Pay Attention To in the next section, but once the MCM Recorder says its complete, you're done. 

As a side note, if your Health, Stamina, and Magicka bars are hanging off your screen, or are too far in the center, you will need to manually adjust them in the TrueHUD MCM, under Player Widget. For 16x9 (Non ultrawide users), set the Player Widget Anchor X to Zero. For 21x9 Users, set the same
setting to -154. I hope to have this ironed out in a future update, but TrueHUD doesn't like to maintain changes, and I play on a 21x9 screen.
