## Performance Profile

Included with Living Skyrim 4 is an optional additional profile that you can select. The Performance Profile should drastically improve the in-game performance of the list on weaker systems. To switch to it, use the Profiles drop-down menu in Mod Organizer 2 to switch to the "LS4 - Performance" profile.
