Can you believe we've done twenty of these now? That seems absurd. Oh well. Pull up a chair.

Coffee? Tea? Milk? OJ? Very good. 

Let's talk about some modlists.

**Living Skyrim 4** is coming along nicely. We're well into working on Beta 5 and should have that ready early in January. I think so far the beta has gone about as expected: lots of bugs, lots of weirdness, some mod changes here and there. Overall I'm happy with how it's proceeding. I also plan to do another livestream of the list at some point once we get Beta 5 out and into the world - stay tuned for more details on that.

And yes, we're still planning to discontinue Living Skyrim 3 on January 1st, 2023.

**POTD**, surprisingly, I actually have some news on. Dace has been hard at work with the list overhauling and tweaking it. We don't have a release date for what we're calling the "POTD 2.0" update yet, but once we've had some time to go through everything and fix up some stuff we'll get that to you.

I also have some news about **MOISE**! GravenImages has been working on updating that list and, once again, we'll get that to you soon-ish. I believe the plan is for some of the mods to get swapped out and also add some new ones. There's also a super secret project related to MOISE that we'll share more details about as we get it hammered out. If you like Morrowind, you'll love what we have planned.

**Masterstroke** is in a mostly good place, but if you've been following along with it, you know that I'm planning the 1.5.0 update for sometime in late January. We want to add a *lot* of mods and also overhaul a few categories in the list. I expect if you like the current iteration of Masterstroke, you'll like 1.5.0 even more.

For **Everfall**, I thought I'd just pass along that the list is in a good place and there aren't currently any plans to update it. Dace did a great job with the list and if you haven't played Dragon's Dogma (or you have and want something new and refreshing), I can highly recommend it.

Now let's talk about some other exciting things that are in the works. If you've seen the homepage of the FG's Modlists website, you might have some idea what this is referring to.

**Atelier 2** is the long-awaited successor to Atelier, and with Day7's vision at the helm we're going to work very hard to get this modlist released in 2023. I want to have Atelier 2 built and ready for release by July of 2023, so... yeah. That's a thing.

**President Eden's Paradise** is the Fallout 3 modlist. I'm earnestly strugging with a solid idea of what I want to do with it and have, unfortunately, made no progress on that front. I don't have any information about when it will be ready or what it will contain yet. Hopefully that's something else we can hammer out in 2023.

**WEEEFT** is a very barebones modlist for The Witcher: Enhanced Edition focused on the Rise of the White Wolf mod. Overall, this list is a mostly graphical overhaul of the first Witcher game with many bug fixes, texture replacers, and so on. I have this list *almost* ready to go, but need to do some final tweaking. However, I am happy to report that I've completed a playthrough of the entire game using the modlist, so expect it to be ready for a playthrough on day one of its release.

**Silent Skyrim** is the newest addition to the lineup of upcoming modlists, and this one is a special one. It will be a Skyrim: Special Edition modlist with a very strong horror theme. We've already started compiling ideas for mods we want to include in the list, and it'll be a unique one among Skyrim modlists for sure. We're planning to release this modlist on October 30th, 2023. (Just in time for Halloween!)

But if you thought that was all we have planned, oh boy do I have news for you. We also have *two more* modlists that we're in the brainstorming phase for. I don't want to give away all of my secrets, so for now know that you should be very excited.

All in all, this will bring the FG's Modlists umbrella to cover 11 modlists. 2023 is going to be an extremely exciting year for us and I can't wait to share what we have planned.

Cheers.

FG
