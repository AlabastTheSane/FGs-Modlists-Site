Masterstroke is intended to be customized to suit your playstyle. You can make things as hard or easy as you'd like, or turn off several features that you're not interested in using. Below you'll find information about things that can be safely customized. Most of the following changes should be made in the MCMs for Masterstroke *after you have run the initial setup process for the MCMs*.

Our Wiki provides additional information and tips about customizing Masterstroke to your liking: [Click here](https://wiki.fgsmodlists.com/en/masterstroke)

## Out-Of-Game Changes
Some changes to the list must be made in Mod Organizer 2 before launching the game.

### Skin Textures
The default skin texture in Masterstroke is Fair Skin, if that isn't to your liking we have prepared several options for you to choose from. They are listed under the Customization separator in the left pane of MO2. Note that you should only have one skin texture enabled at a time, it is not possible to combine them.

### Bodyslides & OBody
OBody can be safely disabled in the left pane of MO2 if you do not want NPCs to have randomized bodyslide presets. Note that if you disable OBody, you will need to generate your own Bodyslides using Bodyslide. Support is not provided for generating your own Bodyslides.

### Skimpy Outfits
Masterstroke contains additional bodyslides that allow you to select whether male and female outfits are skimpy or not. In the left pane of MO2, you can enable either "Masterstroke Bodyslides (Skimpy Male)" or "Masterstroke Bodyslides (Skimpy Female)", or both if you want everyone to be wearing skimpy outfits.

### Physics
By default, Masterstroke has a few options for the physics applied to your character. In-game, you can switch between CBPC and SMP physics by pressing `Numpad +`. If you find that neither of these is to your liking, you can safely disable `3BA 3BBB CBPC Realistic Firm Breasts Butt and Thighs (3BA RFBBT)` in the left pane of MO2. This will make the CBPC option a bit bouncier.

## Difficulty & Realism

If you'd like the make the list more (or less) difficult, you'll need to tweak a few things. You can also experiment with these settings if you'd like to tweak your experience. 

### Milk Addict
In this MCM you can tweak various features regarding becoming addicted to milk/lactacid. You can make it so you become addicted much faster or much slower.

### Milk Mod
- Settings
  - Difficulty: Whatever you want

Changing this setting makes it so you have to get milked more (or less) to increase your Milk Maid level.

### Public Whore
The settings in this menu can make it easier or more difficult to finish being the Public Whore.

### Sets of Skills
If you opt to not pick a class using Sets of Skills, you will not receive class bonuses which can make the game harder.

### Simply Balanced
There's no correct answer here, you'll need to read through this MCM and see what settings you would like to change. With the Simply Balanced MCM you can make the game much harder or much easier. Play with the settings and see what works for you.

### Sunhelm
The survival mechanics can be tweaked to affect how frequently you need to fulfill your needs, or disabled completely.

### Deviously Enchanted Chests
In this MCM you can change how often traps that place Devious Devices on your character occur, as well as control how frequently keys appear. Changing these settings can make the Devious Devices experience much harder or much easier.

### Devious Devices
In this MCM you can change the difficulty of escaping toys as well as turn off various features related to Devious Devices, if that's what you want.

### Trade & Barter
- Barter Rates
  - Barter Preset: Whatever you want

Making this change will make items sell for more or less and increase or decrease the cost of purchasing items.

### SexLab Defeat
In this MCM you can change the requirements to be defeated as well as what happens when you are defeated. It can also be disabled completely if you want to forego the defeat mechanics in the list and would instead prefer to just die.

## Content
Some content is not to everyone's tastes and can be safely disabled if you are not a fan of that content.

### Fill Her Up
In this MCM you can modify or disable the mechanics related to being filled with fluids.

### Gender Bender
While this only works with female player characters, Gender Bender can be optionally enabled or disabled if you either want or don't  want the ability to add a schlong to your character. It is recommended you leave this disabled if you do not want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character, but should be enabled if you do want to play as a futa/femboy/trans character. You can also enable futa NPCs using Gender Bender.

### Keep It Breezy
Keep It Breezy allows you to swap normal armor for its Bikini variant. It can be modified or disabled in this mod's MCM.

### Milk Addict
The addiction to milk features can be disabled in this MCM.

### Milk Mod
If you do not want to use the milk features of the list, these can be tweaked and disabled in this mod's MCM.

### Scrappies Matchmaker
The locations of where matchmaking occurs can be modified and disabled in this MCM.

### Deviously Enchanted Chests
This MCM allows for trapped containers to be disabled if you do not want these mechanics.

## Other
Various other tweaks can be applied to Masterstroke depending on your preferences.

### Quick Light
The lightsource can be modified safely to be brighter or less bright.

### Hotkeys
You should refer to the [Masterstroke Keymap](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0cd559c4d9f1a88b965b552e961a906c) before changing hotkeys, but the hotkeys can be reassigned freely.

### SmoothCam Preset
You can safely change the SmoothCam preset in this mod's MCM if you do not like the default preset. You can and should experiment to see which camera variant you like best.

## Creature Profile

Almost all of the mods added in the Creature Profile have MCMs that allow you to tweak or disable things. Check the MCM for your options. Note that some of the mods in the creature profile have very touchy MCMs that require some patience, such as Estrus Chaurus. Be careful and go slow when making changes to these mods.

## Things You Shouldn't Mess With
The following items should not be changed.

### HUD
The various widgets and HUDs are affected by several mods and shouldn't be modified.

### SexLab
The configuration for SexLab itself is set up in such a way that things should work as smoothly as possible. Tweaking things in this MCM isn't recommended.
