## Beginner's Tips
By Mainframe

- First of all, go through the mods for combat and magic and figure out how to actually play this new version of skyrim, there's a lot thats different. 
- There are survival mods as well, though they are not very harsh compared to the old Frostfall package so don't stress too much. What they do however is add several new crafting systems that can really give you a leg up.  Hunterborn, changes how animals are looted, you now need to actually skin and butcher them for their parts. Get a knife from a vendor (may have to increase the rate of vendors having knives) or make your own, either at a forge or through scrimshaw.
- Which brings us to scrimshaw. Between Campfire crafting "Make Item" and Hunterborn crafting "Scrimshaw" you can make a ton of stuff pretty easily. The Forage power will let you gather a rock, and then make a stone knife, so you can harvest pelts and bones. You can make a "Hunters cache" to store items anywhere in the world. You can create portable Tanning Racks, Enchanting stations and a Mortar and Pestle for mobile alchemy
- You will wonder "where is my map?" You must find and equip a map in order to use it, but don't stress too much; getting lost is half the fun and you have a Sense Direction power. Bandits or stores often have maps, and they can be repaired at a leather station.
- The Public Whore numbers are very high and you'll spend 3+ hours locked in a yoke sucking dicks if you get enslaved, so perhaps turn that down (unless that what you want for your playthrough).
- Don't bother hoarding everything... carry weight is reduced and items don't sell for as much as you think they do. carrying every bandit's Hide Armor won't be worth it.
- You also must sleep to level up.

## Character Creation

Make your character as normal using RaceMenu. No other steps are required before completing MCM Configuration and the Post-MCM steps.

## MCM Configuration

When you are finished making your character, a bunch of text will start scrolling in the top left-hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.** If you receive any pop-up messages during this wait, click through them.

Now, *save your game*. Then *load that save.*

A popup will appear from SexLab - Sexual Fame talking about a consistence check of Papyrus location storage failing. This popup can be safely ignored, the issue will be resolved in a moment by MCM Recorder.

Once again, text will appear in the top left hand corner of the screen. **Wait for all text to disappear from the top left before proceeding.**

Now, go into the MCM and find MCM Recorder.

Click on the Masterstroke MCM option. You'll be prompted to exit the MCM. Do so. You'll then receive a popup with information about the MCM preset you've chosen. Click "Run Recording".

If you see a message saying "`Could not find MCM Option: Mod name: Sexlab Field name SSL__InstallUpdateSexlab(1.63)`", nothing is wrong, simply press continue and allow the recording to continue.

Once again, ***WAIT.*** This can take up to 10 minutes to complete. During this wait, if you receive any pop-up messages, click through them. When it is finished, you will receive one final pop-up message stating the MCMs are now configured.

Now *save your game*. Then *load that save.* Yes, this must be done a second time.

After this, you just have two final tasks before you begin playing.

## Post-MCM Configuration Chracter Creation

### Sets of Skills

Sets of Skills is a class mod that I encourage you to read the mod page about. It will allow you to select a class for your character that will give you buffs as you level up. Be sure to read the options carefully. To select a class, open the Sets of Skills MCM and pick a class from the dropdown menu.

### OBody

You likely want to customize the body of your character. To do so, *with all menus closed*, press the `letter U` key. A menu will appear with all of the installed body presets. You can select whichever one you like and can change it at any time by pressing the `letter U` key to open the menu again. This also works for NPCs - aim your crosshair at the NPC whose body you would like to change, press the `letter U` key and then pick a new body preset for them. 

### SexLab

The SexLab MCM contains an option for your character to be heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual. You should open the MCM for SexLab and select your character's preference under the Sex Diary menu.

### Hotkeys

Unfortunately MCM Recorder does not like setting hotkeys, so the following hotkeys must be set manually:

#### Take Notes!
- Controls
  - Open Journal: B

#### Immersive HUD
  - Toggle: RAlt
 
#### Valhalla Combat

If you wish you use the Executions feature of Valhalla Combat, you should set its hotkey in the Valhalla Combat MCM.

#### TK Dodge RE

If you wish to change the default dodge key from Left Alt to something else, use the `TK_Dodge_RE.ini` located in `[Install Folder]\mods\TK Dodge RE\SKSE\Plugins` to change it. A list of DirectX Scancodes for keyboard keys can be found [here.](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/DirectX_Scancodes_And_How_To_Use_Them)

#### SL Tools
- SL Tools Menu: O

#### Leadership
- Hotkey: K
